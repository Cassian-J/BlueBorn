Calcul du Score
Score=((PV restants%+(|(degat mis×4) - degat subis|)×5)×(Handicap))×10
Handicap= 1+(Différence totale des stats/100)
Différence totale des stats = (-atk% - spd% - rspd%- fr% - hp% - pspd%)/5
les changements de stats peuvent aller de -25% a +25% soit un multiplicateur maximal de 150% et minimal de 50%

exemple de différence de stats:
maximal:
  atk  -50% -> + 10 %
  spd  -50% -> + 10 %
  rspd -50% -> + 10 %
  fr   -50% -> + 10 %
  hp   -50% -> + 10 %
multiplicateur de 150%
minimal:
  atk  +50% -> - 10 %
  spd  +50% -> - 10 %
  rspd +50% -> - 10 %
  fr   +50% -> - 10 %
  hp   +50% -> - 10 %
multiplicateur de 50% 

soit 50 point <=> 250% de stats de différences
soit  1 point <=> 5% de stats de différences

score maximal théorique si aucun soin n'est pris:
PV restants% = 100
degat mis = 163
degat subis = 0
Différence totale des stats = 50

Score=((100%+(|(163×4) - 0|)×5)×(1+(50/100)))×10=50400
Handicap= 1+(50/100)

score minimal théorique si aucun soin n'est pris :
PV restants% = 1
degat mis = 60
degat subis = 162
Différence totale des stats = -50

Score=((1%+(|(60×4) - 162|)×5)×(1+(-50/100)))×10=1930
Handicap= 1+(-50/100)

calcul de multiplicateur de différence de stats
joueur 1:
-(15-(-25))/5= -8 points
Différence totale des stats = -8
joueur 2:
-(-25-15)/5= 8 points
Différence totale des stats = 8

la partie dure 155 seconds
Le gagnant a 35% de c'est pv a la fin de la partie

calcul:
Score=((PV restants%+(|(degat mis×4) - degat subis|)×5)×(Handicap))×10
Handicap= 1+(Différence totale des stats/100)
PV restants% = 35
degat mis = 120
degat subis = 65
Handicap= 1+(Différence totale des stats/100)

si le joueur 1 gagne:

Différence totale des stats = -8

donc ScoreJoueur1 = ((35+(480-65)×5)×(1+(-8/100)))×10 = 19,412
donc si le joueur 1 gagne, il a un score de 19,412


si le joueur 2 gagne:

Différence totale des stats = -8

donc ScoreJoueur2 = ((35+(480-65)×5)×(1+(8/100)))×10 = 22,788
donc si le joueur 2 gagne, il a un score de 22,788
